# Project plan:
1. Read "Joy of Elixir" by Ryan Bigg. This will help me learn elixir concepts in a fun and engaging way. https://joyofelixir.com/i-but-who-is-this-book-for-really
2. Choose from the list of things that I can do to improve the tic-tac-toe game
3. Set small goals, like implementing one feature at a time.
4. Reflect and quiz yourself.

# Things I can do to improve this tic-tac-toe program

## Web Version with Phoenix LiveView
Build a web version of Tic-Tac-Toe using Phoenix LiveView.

Players can play in the browser — no JavaScript needed!

## Multiplayer
Use Elixir processes and message passing to let two people connect and play a game in real time (via terminal or web).

This is a huge step toward understanding concurrency and what Elixir is famous for.

## Single players using algorithms.
Let player play against a simple bot (e.g., pick a random empty cell).

Later upgrade it to be smarter using Minimax algorithm.

## Level 1 – Improve the Core Game
1. Game Restart Option
Ask the player if they want to play again after a win or draw.

If yes, reset the board and start a new game.

2. Score Keeping
Track how many games each player has won across sessions.
